Cook and stir onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir ketchup, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into onions; bring to a simmer and cook until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. - Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from bag and discard marinade. - Cook chicken on the preheated grill until lightly browned on all sides, about 1 minute per side. - Turn off one of the grill burners or move the coals and move chicken so there is no heat source directly below it. - Baste drumsticks with the sauce and cook another 10 minutes; turn again and baste chicken with sauce. Continue to grill drumsticks until juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
